    <title>Compatibility and versioning</title>

    <para>As of JBossRemoting 2.0.0 versioning has been added to guarantee
    compatibility between different versions. This is accomplished by changing
    serialization formats for certain classes and by using wire versioning. By
    wire versioning, mean that the version used by a client and server will be
    sent on the wire so that the other side will be able to adjust
    accordingly. This will be automatic for JBossRemoting 2.0.0 and later
    versions. However, since versioning was not introduced until the 2.0.0
    release, if need to have a 1.4.x version of remoting communicate to a
    later version, will need to set a system property on the 2.0.0 version so
    that knows to use the older wire protocol version. The system property to
    set is 'jboss.remoting.pre_2_0_compatible' and should be set to true.
    There are a few minor features that will not be fully compatible between
    1.4.x release and 2.0.0, which are listed in the release notes.</para>
